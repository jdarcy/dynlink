This was inspired by a problem we faced in Gluster. How do we have one of our
daemon executables dynamically load a translator, such that the translator could
link back to *some* symbols in the executable without having visibility to
*all*? The obvious solution is to split the executable into a shared library to
which both the executable and the translator link ... but that doesn't quite
work. We need many symbols to be visible to the executable but not the
translator, and such selective visibility is just not a thing to the folks who
write linkers. Alternatively, we could split *just* those pieces that
translators need to call into a separate shared library, but the dependencies
were a bit too complicated for that to be easy.

Either of these solutions would be fine and probably preferred in the situations
where they're applicable, but sometimes - only sometimes! - a bit of magic can
be preferable to a lot of refactoring. This solution involves two parts.

(1) Make an executable shared library. The translator can link against this
shared library just like any other, but you can also execute it directly. This
is what the weird service_interp stuff in dyn-shell.c is about, along with the
"entry" function both there and in the makefile.

(2) Use -fvisibility and __attribute__((visibility)) to control what symbols
become visible *outside* of the library/executable (i.e. to the translator).
Everything is still visible *inside* the executable regardless, which is what we
want. It's worth reading the -fvisibility section of the ld man page for some
more background.
